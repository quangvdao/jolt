## Overview

Dory is a transparent polynomial commitment scheme with excellent asymptotic performance, based on the work of Jonathan Lee ([eprint 2020/1274](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1274)). This implementation provides a clean, modular architecture with strong performance characteristics and comprehensive test coverage.

**Key Features:**
- **Transparent setup**: No trusted setup ceremony required with optional disk persistence
- **Logarithmic proof size**: O(log n) group elements
- **Logarithmic verification**: O(log n) GT exps and 5 pairings
- **Modular design**: Pluggable backends for curves and cryptographic primitives
- **Performance-optimized**: Vectorized operations, optional prepared point caching, and parallelization with Rayon
- **Flexible matrix layouts**: Supports both square and non-square matrices (nu ≤ sigma)
- **Homomorphic properties**: Commitment linearity enables proof aggregation

## Installation

Add `dory-pcs` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
dory-pcs = "0.1"
```

Or with specific features:

```toml
[dependencies]
dory-pcs = { version = "0.1", features = ["backends", "disk-persistence"] }
```

For maximum performance with all optimizations:

```toml
[dependencies]
dory-pcs = { version = "0.1", features = ["backends", "cache", "parallel", "disk-persistence"] }
```

## Architecture

### Core Modules

- **`primitives`** - Core trait abstractions
  - `arithmetic` - Field, group, and pairing curve traits
  - `poly` - Multilinear polynomial traits and operations
  - `transcript` - Fiat-Shamir transcript trait
  - `serialization` - Serialization abstractions

- **`setup`** - Transparent setup generation for prover and verifier

- **`evaluation_proof`** - Evaluation proof creation and verification

- **`reduce_and_fold`** - Inner product protocol (prover/verifier)

- **`messages`** - Protocol message structures (VMV, reduce rounds, scalar product)

- **`proof`** - Complete proof data structure

- **`error`** - Error types

### Backend Implementations

- **`backends::arkworks`** - Modular Arkworks backend with BN254 curve (requires `arkworks` feature)
  - Field wrappers (`ArkFr`)
  - Group wrappers (`ArkG1`, `ArkG2`, `ArkGT`)
  - Polynomial implementation
  - Optimized MSM routines
  - Blake2b transcript
  - Serialization bridge

## How It Works

Dory uses a two-tier (also known as AFGHO) homomorphic commitments:

1. **Polynomial Representation**: Coefficients are arranged as a 2^ν × 2^σ matrix (constraint: ν ≤ σ)
2. **Row Commitments** (Tier 1): Each row is committed using multi-scalar multiplication in G1
3. **Final Commitment** (Tier 2): Row commitments are combined via pairings with G2 generators
4. **Evaluation Proof**: Uses a VMV (Vector-Matrix-Vector) protocol with reduce-and-fold rounds

The protocol leverages the algebraic structure of bilinear pairings to achieve logarithmic proof sizes and verification times.

### Homomorphic Properties

Dory commitments are linearly homomorphic, meaning:
```
Com(r₁·P₁ + r₂·P₂ + ... + rₙ·Pₙ) = r₁·Com(P₁) + r₂·Com(P₂) + ... + rₙ·Com(Pₙ)
```

This property enables efficient proof aggregation and batch verification. See `examples/homomorphic.rs` for a demonstration.

## Usage

```rust
use dory_pcs::{setup, prove, verify};
use dory_pcs::backends::arkworks::{
    BN254, G1Routines, G2Routines, ArkworksPolynomial, Blake2bTranscript
};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();

    // 1. Generate setup for polynomials up to 2^10 coefficients
    let max_log_n = 10;
    let (prover_setup, verifier_setup) = setup::<BN254, _>(&mut rng, max_log_n);

    // 2. Create a polynomial with 256 coefficients (nu=4, sigma=4)
    let coefficients: Vec<_> = (0..256).map(|_| rand::random()).collect();
    let polynomial = ArkworksPolynomial::new(coefficients);

    // 3. Define evaluation point (length = nu + sigma = 8)
    let point: Vec<_> = (0..8).map(|_| rand::random()).collect();

    let nu = 4;     // log₂(rows) = 4 → 16 rows
    let sigma = 4;  // log₂(cols) = 4 → 16 columns

    // 4. Commit to polynomial to get tier-2 commitment and row commitments
    let (tier_2, row_commitments) = polynomial
        .commit::<BN254, G1Routines>(nu, sigma, &prover_setup)?;

    // 5. Create evaluation proof using row commitments
    let mut prover_transcript = Blake2bTranscript::new(b"dory-example");
    let proof = prove::<_, BN254, G1Routines, G2Routines, _, _>(
        &polynomial,
        &point,
        row_commitments,
        nu,
        sigma,
        &prover_setup,
        &mut prover_transcript,
    )?;

    // 6. Verify: check that the proof is valid
    let evaluation = polynomial.evaluate(&point);
    let mut verifier_transcript = Blake2bTranscript::new(b"dory-example");
    verify::<_, BN254, G1Routines, G2Routines, _>(
        tier_2,
        evaluation,
        &point,
        &proof,
        verifier_setup,
        &mut verifier_transcript,
    )?;

    println!("Proof verified successfully!");
    Ok(())
}
```

## Examples

The repository includes three comprehensive examples demonstrating different aspects of Dory:

1. **`basic_e2e`** - Standard end-to-end workflow with square matrix (nu=4, sigma=4)
   ```bash
   cargo run --example basic_e2e --features backends
   ```

2. **`homomorphic`** - Demonstrates homomorphic combination of 5 polynomials
   ```bash
   cargo run --example homomorphic --features backends
   ```

3. **`non_square`** - Non-square matrix layout (nu=3, sigma=4) demonstrating flexibility
   ```bash
   cargo run --example non_square --features backends
   ```

## Development Setup

After cloning the repository, install Git hooks to ensure code quality:

```bash
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

This installs a pre-commit hook that:
- Auto-formats code with `cargo fmt`
- Runs `cargo clippy` in strict mode
- Checks that documentation builds without warnings

## Performance Considerations

This implementation is optimized for performance:

- **Vectorized Operations**: The `DoryRoutines` trait provides optimized methods for batch operations:
  - `fixed_base_vector_scalar_mul` - Vectorized scalar multiplication
  - `fixed_scalar_mul_bases_then_add` - Fused multiply-add with base vectors
  - `fixed_scalar_mul_vs_then_add` - Fused multiply-add for vector folding

- **Prepared Point Caching** (optional `cache` feature): Pre-computes prepared points for setup generators, providing ~20-30% speedup on pairing operations. Initialize with:
  ```rust
  use dory_pcs::backends::arkworks::init_cache;
  init_cache(&prover_setup.g1_vec, &prover_setup.g2_vec);
  ```

- **Parallelization** (optional `parallel` feature): Uses Rayon for parallel multi-scalar multiplications and multi-pairings, providing significant speedup on multi-core systems.

- **Pluggable Polynomial Implementations**: The `Polynomial` and `MultilinearLagrange` traits are exposed, allowing users to provide custom polynomial representations optimized for their specific use cases (e.g., sparse polynomials)

- **Backend Flexibility**: The modular design allows backend implementations to leverage hardware acceleration and custom high performance arithmetic libraries

## Building and Testing

```bash
# Build with arkworks backend
cargo build --release --features backends

# Build with all optimizations (cache + parallel)
cargo build --release --features backends,cache,parallel

# Run tests
cargo nextest run --features backends

# Run all tests with all features
cargo nextest run --all-features

# Run clippy
cargo clippy --features backends -- -D warnings

# Generate documentation
cargo doc --features backends --open

# Run examples (see Examples section above)
cargo run --example basic_e2e --features backends

# Run benchmark with optimizations
cargo bench --features backends,cache,parallel
```

## Features

- `backends` - Enable concrete backends. Currently supports Arkworks BN254.
- `cache` - Enable prepared point caching for ~20-30% pairing speedup. Requires `arkworks` and `parallel`.
- `parallel` - Enable parallelization using Rayon for MSMs and pairings. Works with both `arkworks` backend and enables parallel features in `ark-ec` and `ark-ff`.
- `disk-persistence` - Enable automatic setup caching to disk. When enabled, `setup()` will load from OS-specific cache directories if available, avoiding regeneration.

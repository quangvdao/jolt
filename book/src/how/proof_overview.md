# Anatomy of a Jolt proof

In this section, we give a full specification on the format of a Jolt proof, how it is generated, and the constraints it imposes on the Jolt witness.

(diagram: ELF file => Jolt trace => Jolt witness)

(ELF file => Jolt preprocessing)

(prove: program's IO => Jolt preprocessing => Jolt witness => Jolt proof)

(verify: program's IO => Jolt preprocessing => Jolt proof => accept/reject)
